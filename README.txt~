The following two scripts are meant to export an aiida postgresql database to a Titan graph (which use hbase as a backend).

The postgresExportCSV.sh script allows you to export the main tables of an aiida postgresql database to CSV files.
The gremlinImportCSV.groovy script allows you to import the created CSV files to Titan db.

HOW TO:

First run './postgresExportCSV.sh dir' where dir is the absolute path where you want the CSV files to be stored. Then go to your
titan installation directory and run './bin/gremlin.sh -e dir' where dir is the absolute path to the directory where the generated
CSV files lie.
